    "### Purpose of Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) ecosystem has paved the way as a unified framework for the various models within the field of systems biology. A SBML model primarily consists of Species, Parameters, Reactions, Assignments, and Compartments. In general terms, these represent *state variables*, *equation parameters*, *differential equations*, *composite equations*, and *vessel volumes*, respectively. The SBML model is presented in a reaction-network schema which can be digested into a parameterized system of differential equations (ODEs).\n",
    "\n",
    "As of this writing, there exist over 350 SBML compatible software packages. A vast majority of these packages are little more than simple integrators which provide basic insight into the behavior of the SBML model. Additionally, while these packages aim to inform researchers about specific characteristics of a SBML model, often the lack of clarity in documentation or code-availability leaves the package as a \"one-trick-pony\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The SBML-Sensitivity-Toolbox was conceived to provide a unified, extensible platform for sensitivity-based analysis of SBML models. Written entirely in Python, the SBML-Sensitivity-Toolbox primarily focuses on ODE models."
